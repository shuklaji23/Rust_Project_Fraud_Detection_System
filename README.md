# Fraud Detection System for Financial Transactions 

## Title 

Building a Real-Time Fraud Detection System for Financial Transactions 


## Overview 

This project involves creating a real-time fraud detection system for financial transactions. The system continuously monitors transactions, detects suspicious patterns, and flags potential fraud in real-time. It utilizes advanced rule-based and statistical techniques to evaluate transaction data. The system also allows users to query flagged transactions and view detailed fraud reports. 



## Objective 

Develop a robust fraud detection system to: 

    - Monitor and process financial transactions in real-time. 

    - Identify and flag suspicious transactions based on predefined rules and patterns. 

    - Support advanced query operations to analyze flagged transactions. 

    - Scale to handle a high volume of transactions securely and efficiently. 



## Key Features 

Transaction Monitoring:  

    - Ingest and process financial transactions in real-time. 

    - Evaluate transactions against fraud detection rules. 

Fraud Detection Rules:  

    Detect anomalies based on:  

        - Unusual transaction amounts. 

        - High frequency of transactions from the same account. 

        - Suspicious cross-border transactions. 

        - Transactions originating from flagged IP addresses. 

Flagged Transaction Querying:  

    Query flagged transactions by:  

        - Account ID 

        - Transaction amount 

        - Timestamp 

        - Suspicion reason. 

Fraud Reporting:  

    - Generate summary reports for flagged transactions, categorized by suspicion type. 

Concurrency:  

    - Use concurrency primitives to ensure thread-safe transaction processing. 

Optional Features:  

    - Integrate machine learning-based anomaly detection for advanced fraud detection. 

    - Persist flagged transactions to a database or file. 



## Learning Goals 

    - Understand Rustâ€™s concurrency primitives (Mutex, RwLock, channel) for high-frequency transaction monitoring. 

    - Practice designing rule-based systems for real-time fraud detection. 

    - Build efficient in-memory data structures for querying flagged transactions. 

    - Learn to scale the system for large datasets and high transaction volumes. 



## Implementation Steps 

    Define Core Structures: 

    Transaction:  

        id: u64: Unique transaction ID. 

        account_id: u32: Account associated with the transaction. 

        amount: f64: Transaction amount. 

        timestamp: u64: Unix timestamp of the transaction. 

        origin_country: String: Country of transaction origin. 

        ip_address: String: IP address of the transaction origin. 

    FlaggedTransaction:  

        Includes the transaction details and a reason: String field explaining why it was flagged. 
<!-- *** -->
    Example: 


    #[derive(Debug, Clone)] 

    struct Transaction { 
        id: u64, 
        account_id: u32, 
        amount: f64, 
        timestamp: u64, 
        origin_country: String, 
        ip_address: String, 
    } 

    #[derive(Debug, Clone)] 

    struct FlaggedTransaction { 
        transaction: Transaction, 
        reason: String, 
    } 
<!-- *** -->

    Concurrency Management: 

        - Use Mutex<Vec<Transaction>> for thread-safe storage of incoming transactions. 

        - Use Mutex<Vec<FlaggedTransaction>> for storing flagged transactions. 

    Fraud Detection Logic: 

        Implement predefined rules:  

            - Unusual Amount: Flag transactions exceeding a certain threshold. 

            - High Frequency: Flag accounts with more than X transactions in Y seconds. 

            - Cross-Border Transactions: Flag transactions between specific countries. 

            - Flagged IPs: Use a list of known fraudulent IPs to flag transactions. 

    Real-Time Monitoring: 

        Use a producer-consumer model:  

            - Producer: Simulate incoming transactions and add them to a queue. 

            - Consumer: Evaluate transactions against fraud detection rules and flag suspicious ones. 

    Querying Flagged Transactions: 

        Support queries to filter flagged transactions by:  

            - Account ID. 

            - Suspicion reason. 

            - Transaction timestamp or range. 

            - Amount range. 

    Fraud Reporting: 

        Generate summary reports with:  

            - Total flagged transactions. 

            - Breakdown by suspicion type (e.g., unusual amount, high frequency). 

            - Account-wise and country-wise summaries. 



## Use Cases 

### Real-Time Fraud Detection:  

Monitor transactions dynamically and flag suspicious ones in real-time. 

### Query Flagged Transactions:  

By account: Retrieve all flagged transactions for a specific account. 

By suspicion type: Find transactions flagged for a specific rule violation. 

By time range: Retrieve flagged transactions within a specific timeframe. 

### Generate Fraud Reports:  

Summarize flagged transactions by suspicion type, country, and account. 

### Concurrency:  

Process transactions from multiple accounts concurrently while ensuring thread safety. 



CLI Interaction 

Simulating Transactions: 
```

Simulating transactions... 

Transaction ID: 101 flagged: Unusual Amount - $50,000.00 from Account ID: 1 

Transaction ID: 102 flagged: High Frequency - 5 transactions within 10 seconds for Account ID: 2 

Transaction ID: 103 flagged: Flagged IP - IP 192.168.1.10 for Account ID: 3 
```
 

Querying Flagged Transactions: 

```
> query_flagged_transactions account 1 

Flagged Transactions for Account ID 1: 

[101] Amount: $50,000.00 | Suspicion: Unusual Amount | Timestamp: 1670000000 

 

> query_flagged_transactions reason "High Frequency" 

Flagged Transactions for Reason "High Frequency": 

[102] Amount: $1,000.00 | Account: 2 | Timestamp: 1670000050 
```
